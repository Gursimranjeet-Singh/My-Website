### Achievement: Framework-Free Design

- 💻 **Customization:** Every design element is meticulously crafted, allowing for maximum customization to represent my individual style.
  
- ⚡ **Performance:** By avoiding the overhead of a framework, this portfolio ensures optimal performance, delivering a snappy and efficient user experience.
  
- 📚 **Learning Experience:** Building without a framework provided me with a deeper understanding of CSS fundamentals, layout techniques, and responsiveness.

### Responsive Design

My portfolio is thoughtfully designed to provide a seamless experience on various devices. If you're interested in exploring the nuances of responsiveness and the detailed adjustments made, I invite you to take a closer look at the end of the CSS file.

#### Navigate to the bottom of the stylesheet, where you'll find a section dedicated to media queries. 

These queries dictate how the layout transforms to suit different screen sizes. By examining these queries, you'll gain insights into the specific changes implemented for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Explore the meticulous design choices made to ensure a consistent and visually appealing presentation across a diverse range of devices.
